              We collect information that you provide to us automatically as you navigate through and interact with our Site. During such navigation, we may use automatic data collection technologies to collect certain information about your equipment, browsing actions and patterns, including:

            <br />
            <p>
              The information PieGP collects automatically is statistical data and may include Personal Information, but we may maintain it or associate it with Personal Information we collect in other ways or receive from third parties. We do this because it helps us to improve our Site and to deliver a better and more personalized experience for users like you.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              By providing us with your email address (including by “following”, “liking” or linking your account to our Site on a third party site or network), you consent to our using the email address to send you Site-related notices, including any notices required by law, in lieu of communication by postal mail.

            <p>
              Following any termination or deactivation of your account with us, we may retain your profile information and User Content for an amount of time we deem reasonable and appropriate for archival purposes and to comply with applicable law. Furthermore, we may retain and continue to use indefinitely all information (including User Content) contained in your communications to other users or posted to public or semi-public areas of our Site after termination or deactivation of your account.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              PieGP reserves the right, but we have no obligation, to monitor the User Content you post on our Site. We reserve the right to remove any such information or material for any reason or no reason, including without limitation if, in our sole opinion, such information or material violates, or may violate, any applicable law or to protect or defend our rights or property or those of any third party. We also reserve the right to remove information from our Site upon the request of any third party.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              PieGP may share your Personal Information with third parties for the purpose of improving our Site. If we do this, such third parties’ use of your Personal Information will be subject to obligations of confidentiality. We may store Personal Information in locations outside our direct control (for instance, on servers or databases located or co-located with hosting providers). Any Personal Information or content that you voluntarily disclose for posting to the Site becomes available to the public, as controlled by any applicable privacy or website customization settings made by you. Any applicable privacy settings on the Site will be contained within your account settings page on the Site. If you remove information that you posted to the Site, copies may remain viewable in cached and archived pages of the Site, or if other users have copied or saved that information.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              We have implemented measures designed to secure your Personal Information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration and disclosure. All Personal Information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers (or those of our service providers) behind firewalls. We may store, retrieve, access and transmit your Personal Information in the US or in other countries. Any payment transactions will be performed using our third party payment processors, who will use appropriate security procedures.

            <br />
            <p>
              The safety and security of your information also depends on you. Where PieGP gives you (or where you have chosen) a password for access to certain parts of the Site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. You should not share your password with anyone. You must prevent unauthorized access to your account and Personal Information by selecting and protecting your password appropriately and limiting access to your computer or device and browser by signing off after you have finished accessing your account. The information you share in public areas may be viewed by other users.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we do try to protect your Personal Information, PieGP cannot guarantee the security of your Personal Information transmitted to us or which we obtain. Any transmission of Personal Information is at your own risk. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure and other factors, may compromise the security of user information at any time. We are not responsible for your circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Site.
